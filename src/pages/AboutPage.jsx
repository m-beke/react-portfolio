          <p>My name is Matthew Beke. I am a recent graduate of UCF's Coding Bootcamp. I used to do freelancing work in Film and TV, but am now seeking a career change, and more stable work.</p>
          <p>Computers have always been a hobby of mine. I've always enjoyed working with them, which eventually led to me discovering a passion for coding. I'm excited to turn that passion into potential job opportunities!</p>
